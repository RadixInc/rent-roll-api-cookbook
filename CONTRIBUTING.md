## How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository.

## Guidelines

- Each example should be self-contained and runnable with minimal setup.
- Include a `README.md` in every example folder with prerequisites and usage instructions.
- Use the production API endpoint: `https://connect.rediq.io`.
- Do not commit API keys or secrets. Use environment variables or placeholders.
- Keep dependencies minimal. Prefer standard libraries where possible.
